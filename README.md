**üîç Project Overview:**
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of student success in Accounting courses for Fall 2022, focusing on the impact of engagement through Canvas interactions on academic performance. This study aimed to evaluate how different levels of student engagement, such as time spent on course materials and participation in discussions, correlate with DFW (Drop, Fail, Withdraw) rates.

**Tools Used:**

***Advanced Microsoft Excel: U**tilized for data analysis, transformation, and visualization.

***Power Query**: For efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).

***Pivot Tables**: To summarize, explore, and analyze large datasets interactively.

***What-If Analysis**: Including Data Tables and Scenario Manager to model hypothetical business scenarios.

***Conditional Formatting & Dynamic Dashboards**: For enhanced visual insights.

***VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, IFERROR, and Nested Functions**: For robust data manipulation and accuracy checks.

**üß† Key Responsibilities & Skills Demonstrated:**
**ETL & Data Consolidation:**
Extracted, transformed, and loaded Canvas Interaction Data, Banner Grade Data, and Canvas Gradebook Data to simulate a comprehensive student success database.
Merged datasets using student identifiers to track engagement metrics and grade outcomes.
Cleaned and standardized data, addressing missing values, duplicates, and incorrect formats.

**Data Analysis & Modeling:**
Analyzed Canvas interaction patterns to assess the correlation between student engagement (logins, time spent, participation) and final grades.
Segmented data by modality (in-person vs. online) to model academic success and predict DFW rates.
Engineered variables such as time spent per assignment and number of logins to determine key predictors of student performance.

**Business Analysis & Insights:**
Identified trends and correlations between Canvas engagement metrics and student success, focusing on the DFW rates.
Examined factors influencing student persistence and engagement across different learning modalities.
Provided recommendations on improving student engagement to reduce DFW rates and enhance course design.

**Data Visualization & Reporting:**
Created pivot tables and visualizations to communicate findings on engagement patterns and their impact on student success.
Developed a written report and presentation with actionable insights for improving student outcomes based on engagement data.

**‚úÖ Key Outcomes:**
Delivered a stakeholder-ready analysis linking Canvas engagement to student success, with recommendations for reducing DFW rates.
Provided actionable insights to help design early interventions and refine course strategies for better student retention.
Demonstrated the full ETL and analysis process, from raw data extraction to strategic recommendations.
Strengthened the decision-making framework for improving student engagement and academic performance.
